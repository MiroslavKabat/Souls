# Story behind
I was thinking about create zero-player game, like simulation or AI vs AI game in webbrowser. \
Because I am using Eulerian fields whole professional life, I picked Lagrangian representation of field for this project.\
\
At the same time, I found [this](https://codepen.io/towc/pen/mJzOWJ) project and I fall in love with those small, colorful, shiny, and simple units of light with particles around. 

After 20 hours of coding, listening to good music and many hours of watching those cute creatures flying around I am happy with result! 😁
